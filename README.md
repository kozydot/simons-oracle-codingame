the solution simulates the oracle's logic to determine `s`

1.  **constraint tracking**: we process queries sequentially, maintaining a set of unique queries that have received distinct results
2.  **forbidden values**: for each pair of unique queries `(uᵢ, uⱼ)`, their xor `uᵢ ⊕ uⱼ` becomes a forbidden value for `s`
3.  **forcing condition**: at each new unique query `qₖ`, we check if assigning it a new result would eliminate all remaining possibilities for `s`; if so, a "forcing point" is reached
4.  **deducing s**:
    *   if forced, `s` is determined by `qₖ ⊕ uⱼ`, where `uⱼ` is the earliest unique query that forms a valid `s`
    *   if never forced, `s` is the lexicographically largest non-forbidden value
5.  **result generation**: once `s` is found, we generate results for all queries by assigning a unique character to each `{q, q ⊕ s}` pair
